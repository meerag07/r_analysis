The project executes the following commands as required by the project 
Download the File 
  downloads the file from the UCI HAR Datatset

Naming Files 
  Assign Data to each variable/Label each dataset
  featuresfile <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
    features that came from the accelerometer 
  activitieslabelfile <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
    activities performed when measurements were taken 
  testsubjectfile <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
    contains test data of 9/30 subjects 
  testvariablesfile <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
    contains recorded test data 
  testactivityfile <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
    test data for record labels 
  trainsubjectfile <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
    train data on 21/30 subjects 
  trainvariablesfile <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
    recorded features train data 
  trainactivityfile <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
     train data of code labels 
     
Merges the Data Set 
  X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
  Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
  Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
  CombineFile (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function
  
Cleaning Dataset
  CleanDat (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, 
  selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement
  
Cleaning Dataset
  naming the dataset columns with the correct names 
  code column in TidyData renamed into activities
  All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
  All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
  All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
  All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
  All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
  All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
  All tbody in column’s name replaced by TimeBody
  All g in column’s name replaced by Gravity

Final data 
  FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, 
  after groupped by subject and activity.
  Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
